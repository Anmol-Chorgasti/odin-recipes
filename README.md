    This is a beginner level project that I have undertaken as a part of The Odin Project. 

    The main focus of this project was to use the major HTML elements and creating a rudimentary website that displays recipes of three of my favourite recipes.

    The main landing page (index.html) just contains the title of the project and relative links to the recipes. Each recipe has been stored on a seperate html document, with the image of the dish, the ingredients, and the steps required to create the dish.
